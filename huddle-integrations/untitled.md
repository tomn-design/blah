# Eventbrite Registration

## Eventbrite Integration

Huddle can integrate directly with your Eventbrite event and automatically create new accounts for your ticket holders when new tickets are purchased through your Eventbrite event page. As new tickets are purchased we will send your attendee an invite email containing a magic link that will allow them to login to your event.

### Create an API Key <a id="create-an-api-key"></a>

To integrate with Eventbrite you need to provide your account manager with an Eventbrite API key and your Eventbrite URL.

You can create an API key by visiting [https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/platform/](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/platform/) and clicking "Get Free API Key".

After clicking "Get a Free API Key" you will be prompted to login to your Eventbrite account.

Ensure that you login to the account that you have used to create your Eventbrite event that will integrate with Huddle.

Once you've logged into your account you will be provided with a "private token" that will allow Huddle to access your Eventbrite event information.

### Send us your API key <a id="send-us-your-api-key"></a>

Once you have your new API key make sure to copy this code \(e.g. `6HAI46A534GM7QM44J6B`\) and send this to your Huddle account manager along with your Eventbrite URL and we'll do the rest!
