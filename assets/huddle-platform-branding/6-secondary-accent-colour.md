# 6 - Secondary Accent Colour

The secondary accent colour is used in conjunction with the primary accent colour on the Huddle Platform. It will be used when multiple interactions are required by attendees to differentiate between options. An example of this is on the session page when a attendee can register for a session and also download a Calendar.ics. This can be seen below:
