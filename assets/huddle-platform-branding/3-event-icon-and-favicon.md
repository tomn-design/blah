# 3 - Event Icon & Favicon

The Event icon fits in at the top of the Sidebar navigation on the left hand side of the Huddle UI. The event icon is made for a simplified symbolmark of your full event logo. It ensures your branding can be seen on any page of the Huddle platform. You should minimise use of any text as this may not be legiable on smaller screen sizes.

**Event icon:**

Size: 60 x 60px

Filetype:  **.SVG / .AI / .EPS** \( File size not important\)
{% endhint %}

This event icon will also be used as your events **Favicon.**  
  
A **favicon** is a small 16×16 pixel icon that serves as branding for your website. Its main purpose is to help visitors locate your page easier when they have multiple tabs open. Due to their tiny size, favicons work best as simple images or one-to-three characters of text. Favicons are not to be confused with logos but are sometimes the same. Due to its small size and resolution, the favicon may need to be an even smaller sizer or part of a company’s original logo.
