# HTML & Import Scripts

Within the Huddle platform, static pages have the ability to use inline HTML and code imports to style the layout of a static page. Examples of pages that this can be seen on are the Resources and Community Board pages. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Its important that these pieces of code are **NOT EDITED** **or changed** as this may prevent a page from being viewed in its correct format
{% endhint %}
