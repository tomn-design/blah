# Netlify - Understanding the UI.

Netlify is the core Content management system \(CMS\) being used by Huddle. 



### The CMS is made up of two main areas: 

* **Contents -** Contents are made up of a series of **Collections**, which are grouped pieces of data about your event. For example your events speakers would all be grouped into a "Speakers" collection. 
* **Media -** Your like other content management systems, you can upload assets and images to this area to be used accross the platform. 

You can access these two areas by clicking on the navigation bar located at the top of the CMS

### Collections 

Collections are located on the left hand side of the User Interface in the CMS. To navigate between collections, click on one of the elements and the body content on the right hand side will change..
